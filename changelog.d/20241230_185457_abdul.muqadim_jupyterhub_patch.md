- ðŸ’¥[Feature] Renamed the `jupyter-lab-dockerfile` to `jupyterlab-dockerfile` for consistency across the Tutor ecosystem and added the `jupyterhub-dockerfile` patch to the JupyterHub Dockerfile for customization. If you were previously using the patch with the old name, update your configuration to reflect the new name to ensure compatibility. (by @Abdul-Muqadim-Arbisoft)
